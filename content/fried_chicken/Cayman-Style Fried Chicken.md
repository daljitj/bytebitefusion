Indulge in the vibrant flavors of the Caribbean with this recipe for Cayman-Style Fried Chicken! Tender, succulent strips of boneless chicken breast are marinated for hours in a stimulating blend of buttermilk, minced garlic, hand-chopped onions, and Scotch bonnet peppers. This ensnares the chicken in a flavourful nest, letting the juices penetrate every fiber for an incomparable taste. 

The spiciness of the Scotch bonnet pepper, combined with an ensemble of handpicked herbs and spices like black pepper, salt, fragrant tangy paprika, aromatic dried thyme, earthy allspice, and warm nutmeg, infuses each chicken strip with a tantalizing mix of flavors that dance on your taste buds. 

When the marinating process is complete, each strip is dredged in all-purpose flour, creating a light crust that will cradle our chicken, preserving its moistness while creating a gloriously crispy shell when fried. Sizzling away in a pan filled with vegetable oil, the marinated and breaded chicken transforms into a beautiful golden-brown delicacy, each piece a melody of textures and tastes.

Extracted from the oil with a slotted spoon, these fried chicken strips are drained on a paper towel-lined plate, removing excess oil and ensuring each piece remains crisp and heavenly. 

Whether served on a bed of coconut rice and peas, coupled with a side of caramelized, sweet fried plantains, or just on its own, this Cayman-Style Fried Chicken truly brings the Caribbean to your dining room. It's a recipe that takes your palate on an exotic holiday, each bite a reminder of the sun-kissed, spice-filled islands from which this recipe originates. For an extra dimension of crunch and refreshment, serve it alongside a zesty coleslaw. Enjoy this escape in the form of a meal!

Ingredients: 

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups vegetable oil 
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 onion, minced
- 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, deseeded and minced 
- 2 teaspoons black pepper
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon allspice
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Instructions:

1. In a medium bowl, combine the buttermilk, minced garlic, diced onion, Scotch bonnet pepper, black pepper, salt, paprika, dried thyme, allspice, and nutmeg to make a marinade. Mix until well combined.

2. Add the chicken strips to the marinade, ensuring that all pieces are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for the best flavour.

3. When ready to fry, heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches about 375°F (190°C).

4. While the oil is heating, take the chicken out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature.

5. Put the all-purpose flour in another bowl. Take each piece of chicken out of the marinade, letting the excess drip off, then dip it into the bowl of flour, turning to coat evenly.

6. Carefully place the breaded chicken pieces into the heated oil. Do not overcrowd the pan; you may need to fry in batches.

7. Fry each piece until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes on each side, adjusting the heat as needed.

8. Remove the fried chicken strips from the oil with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

9. Repeat the process until all the chicken pieces are fried.

10. Let your Cayman-Style Fried Chicken rest for a few minutes, then serve hot. Enjoy this delicious Caribbean meal!

Note: This chicken pairs wonderfully with classic Caribbean staples like rice and peas or fried plantains. It's also great on its own or with a side of sweet and tangy coleslaw. Enjoy!

Ingredients:  

- 12 small tortillas 
- 1 kg of fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 cups of fresh basil leaves 
- 1/2 cup of pine nuts 
- 1/2 cup of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, finely grated
- 2 garlic cloves 
- 1/2 cup of good quality extra virgin olive oil 
- Salt and pepper to taste 
- 2 cups of cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 cups of arugula
- 1 cup of buffalo mozzarella, cut into bite-sized chunks
- 1 lemon, sliced into wedges
- 2 avocados, halved, pitted, and thinly sliced

Instructions: 

1. Start by making the pesto. In a food processor, combine the basil leaves, pine nuts, Parmigiano cheese, garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Process until it forms a paste. 

2. Pour the virgin olive oil into the mixture bit by bit as you continue to blend until you obtain a creamy pesto sauce. 

3. In a pan over medium heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil. When it's heated, add the shrimp. Cook them for around 2-3 minutes or until they turn pink. 

4. Once the shrimps are cooked, take them off the fire and generously coat them with half of the pesto sauce you just made. 

5. Heat the tortillas in a pan, toasting them just until they're warm.

6. Now, assemble your tacos. Spread a spoonful of leftover pesto sauce onto each tortilla. 

7. Layer a few pieces of shrimp onto the tortilla, followed by a few halved cherry tomatoes and some arugula leaves.

8. Place a few chunks of buffalo mozzarella over the mixture and a slice or two of avocado. 

9. Repeat this process until all your tortillas are finished. 

10. Serve the Ligurian style tacos freshly assembled, and add a wedge of lemon on the side of the plate for squeezing over the tacos before eating.

Indulge in a delectable journey to the Far East with every bite of this mouth-watering Northeastern Chinese Style Fried Chicken. This scrumptious dish is brimming with rich flavors, combining succulent pieces of chicken wings or drumsticks, enrobed in a well-seasoned coating and fried to golden perfection.

Starting with a kilogram of prime-quality chicken, each piece is carefully rinsed and towel-dried before being seasoned with a balanced blend of salty and white pepper. Each morsel of chicken is then bathed in a frothy whisked egg mixture, followed by a roll in a bath of cornstarch. This fine coating brings a divine crunch and seal that locks in the juicy taste of the chicken.

The chicken pieces are then plunged into a pool of sizzling hot oil where they dance until they attain a rich, golden hue. Once cooked to perfection, these crispy treats are set aside to drain, as the enticing aroma wafts through the kitchen.

Creating the signature Northeastern Chinese-style sauce brings a symphony of flavors together. This rich, glossy amalgamation blends the complex notes of soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, and hoisin sauce. The addition of sesame oil awards a fragrant nuttiness while sugar balances out the savor with a subtle sweetness. This mixture is expertly thickened with cornstarch and water, forming an inviting sauce that promises to envelop every piece of fried chicken flawlessly.

The sauce meets an aromatic stir-fry of minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped onions, all saut√©ed in vegetable oil. This earthy trinity brings a remarkable depth to the dish, filling the atmosphere with its intoxicating scent. 

The golden chicken pieces are added back in to bathe in the incredible sauce, absorbing the flavors and becoming uniformly coated. Slivers of fresh green onion and dried red chilies are introduced, adding a pop of brilliant color and a spicy kick. 

Go ahead and serve this masterpiece piping hot, garnished with extra green onions for an irresistible finish. Pair it with a fluffy mound of steamed rice or an assortment of vibrant stir-fried vegetables for a wholesome meal.

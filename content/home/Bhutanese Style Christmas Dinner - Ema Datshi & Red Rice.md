This Bhutanese Style Christmas Dinner- Ema Datshi & Red Rice is a fiery yet comforting feast that brings the vibrancy and warmth of Bhutan to your dining table. Embodying a classic Bhutanese delicacy, Ema Datshi, simmered in a cheesy pepper sauce, serenely resting atop a bed of distinctive Bhutanese red rice.

Start your culinary journey by washing 250 grams of the earth-hued Bhutanese red rice. A few times under cold water should wash away any excess starch and retain the grain's natural, rustic charm. Combine this hearty rice, a hint of salt for taste, and 500 ml of water in a broad, spacious pan that lets the grains dance freely as they cook.

Artistically awaken the dormant flavours by bringing the pot to a tempestuous boil, reflecting the energetic spirit of Bhutan. Once you achieve this turbulent boil, play the symphony of flavours on a lower pitch by reducing the heat, tucking the pan under a cozy lid, and letting it simmer. This unhurried dance, performed for about 20 bountiful minutes, ensures the rice is cooked to a fluffy perfection and is ready to hold the charismatic Ema Datshi.

As the final act in your culinary ballet, perform a gentle fluffing rally with a fork to offer your rice the last finishing touch, and you're ready to plate up. Serve the red rice glowing like warm winter embers beneath the opulent Ema Datshi, making sure that the cheesy, smoky sauce graces every grain.

Remember, Bhutanese cuisine carries with it the fierce passion of their chillies. Be the master of your own spice destiny by adjusting the quantity to your liking. For added complexity and variety, adorn your Ema Datshi with a parade of other vegetables like mushrooms, potatoes, or the color pops of red bell peppers.  If the elusive Bhutanese red rice eludes you, you can use regular rice. But remember, the ebon touch of red rice delivers a unique, earthy flavor that adds a signature Bhutanese flair to your Christmas dinner.

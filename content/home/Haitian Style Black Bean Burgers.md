Indulge yourself in a globally inspired feast straight from the heart of the Caribbean islands, as we guide you through our recipe for Haitian Style Black Bean Burgers. Bursting with bold flavors and packed full of texture, these vegetarian burgers offer a perfect blend of nutrition and a touch of heat that leaves an indelible mark on your tastebuds. 

The burgers' mainstay is two wholehearted cans of black beans providing a rich protein-packed base. Together with a vibrant mix of diced red bell pepper, onion and the unmistakable kick of minced garlic; the flavors begin to intertwine. Scotch bonnet peppers, known for their blazing heat and unique taste, are an addition not for the faint of heart, but rather for those daring to explore. 

The inclusion of eggs brings a silky consistency to our formation, while a dusting of aromatic spices, cumin, thyme and paprika, alongside a dash of soy sauce, brings a world of depth to our burger. Seasoned bread crumbs, thrown into the mix, provide the right crunch that serves as a perfect contrast to the softness of the beans.

Not forgetting the Pikliz - a fiery, tangy slaw that is as integral to Haitian cuisine as is its breathtaking beaches. Shredded medium cabbage, large carrot stripes and finely sliced Scotch bonnet peppers are brought together and showered over with a concoction of white vinegar, lime juice, salt, and sugar heated to perfection. This slaw is an exhilarating dance of flavors, which once chilled does wonders to complement the burger's bold persona.

To bring it all together, the burger patties are pan seared till they adopt a beautiful golden-brown hue, ensuring they are heated to the core. Served on lightly toasted buns, each burger is crowned generously with the invigorating Pikliz. This daring duet of a black bean burger and spicy cabbage slaw is sure to take your tastebuds on an exciting food journey to the very heart of the Caribbean!

Relish your handcrafted Haitian-Style Black Bean Burgers; wholesome, fiery, tangy and utterly unforgettable! Now, or any time your palate craves an exotic getaway.

Food is not static. It is an ever-evolving palette of possibilities. 

When I was younger my favourite Indian dish was chilli paneer. This dish was only ever served to me on special Indian occasions such as weddings and holidays so I always believed it was a traditional Indian dish. But chilli paneer is actually an Indo-Chinese dish, invented by Nathan Wang. It is a fusion of Indian ingredients with Chinese cooking techniques introduced by a wave of Chinese immigrants into India the mid 20th century. Fusion food is a celebration of culinary diversity, a shared cross cultural dialogue that bridges traditions and drives innovation. With the power of AI we can imagine and illustrate potential fusions across a range of dishes with regional variations. No singular person could have enough knowledge to draw on every culinary tradition, particularly for obscure regions, but with the power of AI we can help to broaden the horizon of possibilities and expand the frontier of creativity and innovation

Use common sense and caution on temperatures and cooking times if using these recipes. Ensure meat is internally at a safe temperature for consumption

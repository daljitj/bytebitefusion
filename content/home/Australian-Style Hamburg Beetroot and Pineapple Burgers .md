Experience a taste of the Outback with this unique and flavorful Australian-Style Hamburger Beetroot and Pineapple Burger. This burger is a feisty feast, characterized by bold and innovative flavors synonymous with authentic Australian cuisine. The recipe is a delightful edition to any Barbeque or beach picnic.

The journey begins with 2 lbs of rich, lovingly seasoned ground beef. The patty is lovingly crafted with finely chopped onion and minced garlic, mixed with homemade breadcrumbs and free-range eggs. This combination delivers an elevated and spectacularly aromatic experience.

Next, in homage to the Australian tradition, these flavorful patties are seared to perfection on a medium-high grill. The tantalizing and hearty patties are topped off with a slim layer of cheddar cheese, melting into creamy deliciousness in the final moments of grilling.

But the culinary expedition does not stop here. This mouthwatering patty is given an Australian twist on a fresh, lightly toasted burger bun. The canvas of the bottom half of the bun is adorned with a layer of crispy lettuce. Above it rests the hero of the ensemble, the succulent beef and cheese patty.

Then follows the star of the show: a vibrant slice of beetroot. The earthy and subtly sweet flavor of beetroot complements the juicy patty and enhances the overall taste profile. Next is a heavenly slice of ripe pineapple, its zesty and sweet tang looks to strike a perfect balance with the hearty meat. For the unique Australian touch, a perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg crowns the burger creating a multi-dimensional flavor experience. Finally, a helping of fresh tomato slices introduces a fresh and juicy aroma to elevate the gustatory senses.

Optional toppings like ketchup or mustard, crispy bacon strips, tangy pickles, or caramelized onions allow for the opportunity to tailor the burger to your preferences.

Ingredients: 

- 2 lb of ground beef (you can also substitute with ground turkey or chicken)
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1.5 cups of bread crumbs
- 2 eggs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 slices of beetroot
- 4 slices of pineapple
- 4 sunny-side up fried eggs
- 4 slices of cheddar cheese
- 4 fresh burger buns

Instructions:

1. Place the ground beef, chopped onions, garlic, bread crumbs, and eggs into a large mixing bowl.

2. Season with salt and pepper and mix until all ingredients are combined.

3. Shape the mixture into 4 equal-sized patties. 

4. Set your grill or stovetop to medium-high heat. Cook each patty for about 5-6 minutes on each side or until they're cooked to your preference.

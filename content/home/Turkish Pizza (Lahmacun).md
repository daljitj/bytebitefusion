Ingredients: 

For the Dough:
1. 1 1/2 tsp dried yeast
2. 1 tsp sugar
3. 1/2 cup warm water
4. 1 3/4 cups strong bread flour
5. 1 tsp salt
6. Olive oil

For the Topping:
1. 250g lean ground lamb (or beef)
2. 1 small red bell pepper, finely chopped
3. 1 small onion, finely chopped
4. 1 garlic clove, minced
5. 1 small tomato, finely chopped
6. 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
7. 1 tsp ground cumin
8. 1/2 tsp ground coriander
9. 1/2 tsp chili flakes
10. Salt to taste

Instructions:

1. Start by making the dough. In a large bowl, mix the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Leave it for 5 minutes until it begins to froth. 

2. Add the flour, salt, and a drizzle of olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir until a rough dough forms. 

3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for approximately 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth. Transfer the dough to a clean, oiled bowl, cover with a cloth and set aside in a warm place for about 1 hour.

4. While the dough is rising, prepare the topping. In a large bowl, add the ground lamb, chopped bell pepper, onion, garlic, tomato, parsley, and spices. Mix well until everything is combined.

5. Preheat the oven to its highest temperature. 

6. Once the dough has doubled in size, divide it into small balls (around the size of a golf ball). On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball until itâ€™s quite thin and oval-shaped.

7. Place the flatbreads onto a baking tray and spread the lamb mixture onto each one, making sure to leave a little border around the edge. 

8. Bake in the oven for around 7-10 minutes, or until the edges of the dough are golden brown. 

9. Serve hot with a side of fresh salad, a drizzle of lemon juice, or a dollop of yogurt, and enjoy your Turkish Pizza or Lahmacun.

Note: Lahmacun is usually rolled up like a burrito, with salad inside to eat as a quick meal or snack.

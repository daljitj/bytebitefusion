Ingredients: 

- 1 kg chicken pieces
- 200 grams of flour
- 100 grams of cornstarch
- 2 eggs 
- 500 ml of milk 
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- Oil for frying 
- Lemon wedges, for serving 
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

Instructions:

1. Clean and pat dry chicken pieces with a paper towel. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.

2. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Add milk and mix them together until well combined.

3. In another bowl, mix together the flour and cornstarch.

4. Dip each piece of chicken in the egg and milk mixture, then dredge in the flour mixture. Do this twice for a thick and crunchy coating.

5. Heat the oil in a deep frying pan or pot over medium heat. You'll need enough oil to fully submerge the chicken pieces.

6. Carefully place the coated chicken pieces in the hot oil and fry for about 10-15 minutes on each side. Make sure the chicken is fully cooked before removing it from the pan. It should be golden brown and juices should run clear when you pierce it with a fork.

7. When it's ready, remove the chicken from the heat and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.

8. Serve warm, garnished with parsley and lemon wedges on the side if wished.

9. Enjoy your Serbian-style fried chicken!

Enter a culinary journey through Korea with our delicious recipe for Korean Fried Chicken Banchan style. Brimming with an array of flavors, it's a grub that is sure to animate any dinner table and satisfy your cravings. Each bite will have you savoring crispy chicken pieces, soaked in an exquisite sweet and spicy garlic glaze, crafting an authentic and unforgettable food experience.

Banchan refers to a plethora of side dishes that accompany rice in Korea, but our dish here is going to take the center stage. The Korean Fried Chicken is delicately fried to perfection, its exterior golden and crunchy, and its meat inside tender and juicy. The dish is then tossed around in the sweet and spicy sauce, uniting two worlds of flavor.

The sauce that's adorning the crisp nuggets of chicken is made from a concoction of traditional Korean ingredients: featuring the likes of Korean chili paste (gochujang), ketchup, honey, sesame oil, and a healthy helping of chopped garlic. The resultant glaze opens up a cornucopia of flavors: it's sweet, it's tangy, it's spicy and garlicky- all at once!

We finish our recipe by generously sprinkling sesame seeds and chopped spring onions, adding both texture and subtle flavors. The experience of eating this chicken is nothing short of thrilling, from the moment you crunch down the batter, onto the tender meat and then finally reach the sweet heat from the glaze.

This Korean Fried Chicken, Banchan Style isn't just food, it's a feast. It's a vibrant blend of textures, colors, and flavors, served in a dish. This dish is a testimony to Korea's rich culinary heritage, and is a sure-fire way to impress at your next meal- whether it's a quiet dinner at home, or a grand feast with friends and family. Happy cooking and Bon App√©tit!

Ingredients: 

For the Chicken:

- 1.5 kg chicken, cut into pieces
- 1 cup cornflour
- Salt and pepper
- Vegetable oil for frying

For the Sauce:

- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 cm piece of ginger, peeled and minced
- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 4 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1/2 cup water

2. Deep fry the chicken pieces in batches for 10-15 minutes until they are golden brown and crispy. Drain on a wire rack or paper towel.

3. To make the sauce, heat a little oil in a separate pan and cook the garlic and ginger until fragrant. Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, gochujang, honey and water and simmer for 5-10 minutes until the sauce thickens.

4. Coat the cooked chicken pieces in the sauce and garnish with sesame seeds and spring onions.

5. Serve the Korean Fried Chicken with other banchan dishes like kimchi, gimbap, and pickled radishes. A bowl of sticky rice is also a must! Enjoy your homemade Korean meal.

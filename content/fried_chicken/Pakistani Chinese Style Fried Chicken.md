Ingredients: 

- 500g chicken, cut into pieces
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon white pepper
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 piece of ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder
- 2 tablespoons corn flour
- 1 egg
- Salt to taste
- Oil for frying

For the Sauce:

- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 piece of ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon chili sauce
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 cup chicken stock or water
- 1 tablespoon corn flour
- 1 bell pepper, cut into squares
- 1 onion, cut into squares
- 2 green onions, cut into 2 inch pieces

Instructions:

1. In a bowl, marinate the chicken with soy sauce, oyster sauce, black pepper, white pepper, garlic, ginger, chili powder, corn flour, egg, and salt. Mix until the chicken is fully coated. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.

2. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces and fry until they are golden brown and crispy. Do not overcrowd the pan. Once cooked, take them out and set them aside on paper towel to absorb the excess oil.

3. In a separate bowl, combine all the ingredients for the sauce except the bell pepper, onion, green onions, and sesame oil.

4. Heat a wok or large frying pan over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the bell pepper, onion, and green onions. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes.

5. Add the mixture of sauce ingredients to the wok. Stir well and let it simmer until the sauce thickens.

6. Add the fried chicken pieces to the wok and mix until each piece is coated with the sauce.

7. Stir in the sesame oil just before turning off the heat.

8. Serve the Pakistani Chinese style fried chicken with fried rice or noodles. Enjoy!

Get ready for a Scandinavian spin on a Japanese favorite! This Danish Style Ramen merges the umami-rich depth of traditional ramen with the hearty, comforting flavors of Denmark, creating a truly unique culinary experience. 

Starting with the broth, we fuse classic Asian ingredients - onion, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce - with a Danish touch of buttery richness. The onion is cooked until charred, imparting a subtle smokiness that melds beautifully with the vivid zing of garlic and the warm, aromatic ginger. Savory pork fat or vegetable oil rounds out the flavours, whilst the chicken or vegetable broth serves as a deeply flavorful base. Just a hint of fish sauce and dash of salt later, you have a broth that hums with complexity and comforts the soul.

As the broth simmers, attention turns to the potpourri of toppings. An integral part of any ramen dish, here we pay homage to Danish cuisine with shredded Danish ham and tangy pickled red cabbage. The ham introduces a smoky, salty counterpoint to the acidity of the pickled cabbage, creating a flavour harmony that dances on the palate. Firm, rich hardboiled eggs and crisp, spring onions add further layers of texture and taste.

The star of the show, the ramen noodles, are cooked with precision, ensuring the perfect balance between slurp-worthy tenderness and bite. Once the broth is strained and the solids discarded, the noodles eagerly soak up the delectable broth, ready to be loaded with the Danish toppings. 

The final flourish – a sprig of fresh dill. It’s feathery leaves adding a burst of colour and a hint of freshness to round off this Scandinavian-Japanese fusion.

Served piping hot, Danish Style Ramen is an intriguing and delicious way of reimagining Asia's beloved noodle dish through a Scandinavian lens. It’s comfort food redefined, and a testament to the culinary harmony that can be achieved through unexpected ingredient pairings. Relish in a bowl of Danish-style ramen, a dish that promises to warm the belly and satisfy the most adventurous of taste buds.

Ingredients: 

For the Broth:
- 2 tablespoons butter 
- 1 large onion, halved

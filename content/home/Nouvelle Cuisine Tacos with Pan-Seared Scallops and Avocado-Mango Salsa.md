Capture the flavors of summer all year round with these Nouvelle Cuisine Tacos featuring Pan-Seared Scallops and Avocado-Mango Salsa. This recipe takes an animated twist on the classic Mexican street food, infusing it with an epitome of flair and fancy. The delicacy of the fresh, pan-seared scallops pairs brilliantly with the bright, sweet, and slightly spicy salsa making for an absolutely delightful bite.

The making of the Avocado-Mango salsa involves the precise union of juicy ripe mangoes, creamy avocados, crunchy red onions, and a kick from Jalapeño. A sprinkle of freshly chopped Cilantro leaves and a squeeze of lime juice provide a zesty freshness that enhances the flavors of the salsa. The salsa is refrigerated for cooling freshness which is a perfect juxtaposition to the warm scallops.

The Jalapeño Lime Crema, a creamy accompaniment, begs a special shout-out. Its unique tang comes from the lime zest and juice while Jalapeño pepper introduces a spicy dimension. The marriage of these flavors ends up in a creamy, zingy, chunky wonder that adds a beautiful contrast to the overall dish.

The hero ingredient, fresh scallops, are lovingly seasoned, seared in a shimmering heat of olive oil until they sport a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior while keeping the interior juicy and tender.

Assembling this work of art involves layering a warm tortilla with a perfectly seared scallop, a generous topping of Avocado-Mango salsa, and a drizzle of Jalapeño Lime Crema. Each bite is an explosion of unbelievable flavors that blend seamlessly on the palate.

Stay mindful of the cooking time for scallops as they can turn rusty if overcooked. Also, feel free to substitute scallops with other seafood or veggies to suit your taste. To amp up the experience, serve these gourmet tacos with a chilled white wine or a classic margarita for an exuberant culinary experience.

Ingredients: 

For the Tacos:
1. 12 fresh scallops
2. 1 tablespoon olive oil
3. Salt and freshly ground black pepper
4. 12 mini tortillas

For the Avocado-Mango Salsa:
1. 1 ripe mango, peeled and diced
2. 1 ripe avocado, peeled and diced
3. 1 small red onion, finely chopped
4. 1 jalapeño pepper, seeds removed and finely chopped
5. Juice of 1 lime
6. Freshly chopped cilantro, to taste
7. Salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Jalapeño Lime Crema:
1. 1 cup sour cream
2. Juice and zest of 2 limes
3. 1 jalapeño pepper, seeds removed and finely chopped
4. Salt to taste

Instructions:

1. Start by making the avocado-mango salsa. Combine the diced mango, avocado, red onion, and jalapeño in a bowl. Add in the lime juice, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Mix everything well and refrigerate until needed.

2. Next, prepare the jalapeño lime crema. Combine the sour cream, lime zest, lime juice, and jalapeño in a bowl. Add salt according to your taste. Mix well and refrigerate until needed.

3. Now, cook the scallops. Pat them dry and season both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, place the scallops in the pan. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they become golden brown and slightly crispy. 

4. Warm tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side.

5. Assemble the tacos by placing 1 scallop on each tortilla. Top with a spoonful of the avocado-mango salsa and a drizzle of the jalapeño lime crema.

6. Repeat the process for the remaining tacos. Serve immediately and enjoy these Nouvelle Cuisine Tacos with a beautiful presentation.

Additional Tips: 
1. Scallops are delicate and only need a few minutes to cook. Overcooking can make them tough and chewy.
2. Instead of scallops, you could use shrimp, fish, or even grilled vegetables for a vegetarian version.
3. Pair these tacos with a chilled white wine or margarita for a complete culinary experience.

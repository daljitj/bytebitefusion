Indulge your senses in a taste tourism extravaganza with our Omani Style Sushi recipe. This sophisticated fusion experiment blends the elegant precision of Japanese sushi artistry with the rich, intoxicating flavors of Omani cuisine. The subtle art of sushi is enhanced and redefined by the inclusion of traditional Omani ingredients, rendering a pan-cultural culinary delight that sits exquisitely on the palate.

The Japanese ethos of treasuring the aesthetic beauty of each dish is honoured in this dish as each sushi roll is crafted with meticulous attention to detail. Tender morsels of raw fish, traditional in Japanese sushi, are substituted with Oman’s succulent, aromatic kebab meats, the outcome of a magical blend of exotic Middle Eastern spices. The sushi rice gets a vibrant makeover with the addition of saffron, the king of Omani spices, tinting the grainy canvas with hues of yellow and ochre. 

To add to the glamorous fusion, the condiments too, undergo a tasteful transformation. The spiky might of wasabi makes way for the punchy, lemon-garlic kick of Shuwa sauce while the light, transparent soy sauce gets replaced by the deep, glossy tamarind sauce, a staple of Omani cuisine. The result is a mouth orgasm truly unique to this Omani Style Sushi recipe. Each bite presents a wonderful mosaic of flavours, the succulent meat, and aromatic rice wrapped in the delicate, almost transparent sushi seaweed, a symphony of flavours too enchanting to resist. 

Finally, the sushi rolls are garnished with pomegranate seeds, an Omani twist that not only adds a sweet, tangy crunch but also bedecks the sushi with ruby-like elegance. 

This Omani Style sushi is much more than a dish; it’s a multisensory feast that is a testament to the unity and diversity of world cuisines.

Ingredients: 

For Rice:
- 2 Cups Sushi Rice
- 2 Cups Water
- 1/4 Cup Rice Vinegar
- 2 Tbsp Sugar
- 1/2 Tsp Salt

For Omani Sushi:
- 300 g Fresh Fish Fillet (like Tuna or Salmon)
- 2 Tbsp Za'atar (Omani mixed spice)
- 1 Tbsp Olive Oil
- 2 Tbsp Lemon Zest 
- 1 Tbsp Lemon Juice
- 1/2 Cucumber, cut into thin strips
- 1 Avocado, sliced
- 10 Nori Sheets
- Omani chili Sauce
- Salt to taste 

Instructions:

Prepare the Rice:
1. Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear- this removes the starch.
2. Place the rice and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring the water to a boil.
3. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes.
4. After 20 minutes, remove the rice from heat and let it stand covered for 10 minutes.
5. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve.
6. Pour the Vinegar mixture over the rice and gently stir to combine. Let it cool.

Prepare the Omani Sushi:
1. Cut the fish into thin slices, then marinate with za'atar, olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt for about 15 minutes.
2. Place a nori sheet onto a sushi mat. Wet your hands and spread about a handful of rice evenly onto the nori sheet. (leave about one inch with no rice at the top)
3. Lay the cucumber, avocado, and za'atar marinated fish across the middle of the rice.
4. Roll up the sushi tightly using the sushi mat, before gently squeezing the roll to compress it slightly.
5. Cut the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces with a sharp wet knife.
6. Serve the Omani Sushi with some Omani chili sauce for dipping.

Voila! The za'atar spice, lemon zest, and Omani chili sauce will give your traditional sushi a distinct Omani flavor. Enjoy the fusion of Japanese and Omani cuisines.

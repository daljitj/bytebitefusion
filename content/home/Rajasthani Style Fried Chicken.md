Ingredients: 

1. 1 Kg Chicken (cut into pieces)
2. 1/2 Cup Yogurt
3. 1 Tablespoon Ginger Paste
4. 1 Tablespoon Garlic Paste
5. 2 Tablespoons Red Chilli Powder
6. 1 Tablespoon Turmeric Powder
7. 2 tablespoons Coriander Powder
8. 1 Tablespoon Cumin Powder
9. Salt to taste
10. 2 Cups Gram Flour (Besan)
11. Cooking Oil for frying
12. 2 Tablespoons Ghee
13. 1 Teaspoon Black Pepper Powder
14. Fresh Coriander leaves for garnish

Instructions:

1. Firstly, take the chicken pieces in a large bowl. Add the ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well so that the chicken is well coated with the spices. 

2. Next, add the yogurt to the chicken and mix well. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and put it in the fridge to marinate for at least 2-3 hours. 

3. Once the chicken has marinated, take it out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature.

4. Add the gram flour to the marinated chicken pieces. Make sure to coat each piece of chicken evenly with the flour.

5. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or Kadhai on medium heat. To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small amount of the flour mixture into the oil. If it sizzles and rises to the top, the oil is ready for frying.

6. Gently add the chicken pieces one by one into the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the pan, fry in batches if needed. 

7. Fry the chicken pieces until they turn crispy and golden brown in color. This may take about 10-12 minutes depending on the thickness of the chicken. 

8. Once the chicken is fried, remove it from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain it on a paper towel to remove excess oil.

9. To enhance the flavor, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee in a separate pan, add black pepper powder to it, and pour it over the fried chicken.

10. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve your Rajasthani style fried chicken hot. 

This flavorful and delicious dish is excellent to serve with rice or roti, and is best enjoyed with a side of pickle and yogurt. 

Remember, the key to a good fried chicken is marination, so make sure the chicken is well-marinated before frying. Enjoy cooking and tasting this mouth-watering Rajasthani cuisine.

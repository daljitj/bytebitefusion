Embark on a delightful culinary journey across Southeast Asia with our exotic Malay Style Pizza – a tantalising Satay Pizza that melds together the rich, fragrant flavours of traditional Malaysian satay with the universally beloved Italian delicacy.

Think of a tender, perfectly risen dough base, masterfully handcrafted from wholesome all-purpose flour, the sweetness of sugar, the savory pinch of salt, bound together by the multi-faceted bouquet of vegetable oil, warm water and activated dry yeast. This dough, after a warm nap cocooned within a cloth in a nice cosy space, embodies the unmistakable homey allure of authentic pizza dough.

Then comes our show-stopping centrepiece – the versatile satay sauce, the pulsating heart of this Southeast Asian masterpiece. Awe-inspiring and nuanced in flavour, it offers the creamy indulgence of smooth peanut butter and the sensual silkiness of coconut milk, cut through with the salty tang of soy sauce and the caramel undertones of brown sugar. Garlic, simmered to a golden brown, whispers soft notes of pungency while the ground coriander and chili powder bring their warm, earthy flavours and heat to this intricate dance of tastes. Once amalgamated over medium heat, this sauce is left to cool, enhancing its rich taste profile.

The transcendent dough is then rolled out in anticipation of its flavourful destiny. Laden with a generous layer of cooled satay sauce, it turns into a breathtaking canvas that is riddled with the vibrant colors of toppings - cooked chicken slices for a wholesome bite, thinly sliced onion and bell pepper for a crisp, fresh touch and, mounds of mozzarella cheese that turn into a sea of molten goodness in the oven.

The assembled artistry is then carefully eased onto a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in a searing oven. As the pizza bakes to a golden perfection, the kitchen fills up with an amalgamation of enticing aromas, whetting your appetite for the feast that awaits.

The pizza emerges from the oven with hues of yellows, reds and browns, the cheese bubbling with joy. A sprinkle of fresh cilantro leaves adds a refreshing top note, balancing the rich tastes underneath. Cut into inviting slices, this Malay Style Satay Pizza is best served hot, promising a journey of taste exploration and gastronomical delight with every bite. So dive in and reimagine your pizza nights with this irresistible cross-continental delicacy!

Ingredients: 

For the dough:
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 packet of dry yeast

For the satay sauce:
- 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon chili powder

For the toppings:
- 1 cup cooked chicken breast, thinly sliced
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 1 bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for about five minutes to activate the yeast.

2. Pour the yeast mixture and oil into the flour mixture. Stir until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about ten minutes.

3. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth and let it rise in a warm place for around 2 hours or until it doubles in size.

4. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit (245 degrees Celsius) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside.

5. While waiting for the dough to rise, prepare the satay sauce. In a saucepan over medium heat, cook the garlic until it starts to brown.

6. Add the peanut butter, coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, coriander and chili powder to the saucepan. Stir until all ingredients are well combined and the sauce is smooth. Let it cool.

7. After the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out to fit your pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread a layer of satay sauce onto the dough.

8. Scatter the chicken, onion, and bell pepper over the sauce, then top with the shredded mozzarella cheese.

9. Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbling and the crust is golden brown.

10. Remove the pizza from the oven and garnish with cilantro leaves. Cut into slices and serve while hot.

Enjoy your delicious Malay Style Satay Pizza!

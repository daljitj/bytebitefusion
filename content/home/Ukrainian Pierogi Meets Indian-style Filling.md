- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp of salt

Indian-style Filling:
- 2 potatoes, peeled and chopped
- 1 cup of green peas 
- 2 tbsp of vegetable oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 green chilli, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp of finely grated ginger
- 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 2 tsp of ground coriander
- 1 tsp of ground turmeric
- 1 tsp of garam masala
- Salt to taste

For Serving:
- Sour cream
- Fresh cilantro, chopped

Instructions:

1. Start by making your Pierogi dough. In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add in eggs and water gradually, knead until a smooth dough is formed. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes. 

2. Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Boil potatoes and peas until soft. Drain and mash them coarsely.

3. In a pan, heat vegetable oil. Add the chopped onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Cook until the onions turn translucent. 

4. Add the ground coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for a minute until the spices are well blended. 

5. Add the boiled and mashed potatoes and peas to the pan. Mix well so the potato-pea mixture is well coated with the spices. Remove from heat and allow it to cool.

6. Once the dough has rested, roll it out on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thick. Using a round cookie cutter or glass, cut out rounds of dough.

7. Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center of each dough round. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press the edges with a fork or your fingers to seal.

8. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pierogis in batches in the boiling water until they float to the surface, which should take around 3-5 minutes. Remove and drain.

9. To serve, top the pierogis with sour cream and sprinkle fresh cilantro over the top.

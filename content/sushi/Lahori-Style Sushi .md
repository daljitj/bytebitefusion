Ingredients:  

- 2 cups sushi rice
- Nori sheets 
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 tablespoon salt 
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil 
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 250g salmon fillet
- 200g cooked prawns 
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced thinly
- 1 cucumber, julienned
- 2 carrots, julienned
- 1 ripe Avocado, thinly sliced
- 1 piece Mango, thinly sliced
- Chat masala to taste 
- Tamarind chutney 
- Fresh Coriander leaves (optional) 

Instructions:

1. Start with preparing the sushi rice. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water is clear, then drain.

2. In a saucepan, cook the rice with water. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for about 20 minutes.

3. While the rice is cooking, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a saucepan and heat over medium until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let it cool.

4. When the rice has finished cooking, move it into a large mixing bowl. 

5. Slowly fold in the vinegar mixture into the rice. Keep folding and spreading until it has completely absorbed. This should take about 5 minutes. Set sushi rice aside.

6. Marinate the salmon fillet in sesame oil and soy sauce for about 10 minutes.

7. Arrange a sheet of Nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands and spread a thin layer of the sushi rice over the Nori while pressing it firmly.

8. Lay the marinated salmon, prawns, cucumber, green bell pepper, and carrots along the center of the rice. Sprinkle chat masala to your taste.

9. Roll up the bamboo mat, pressing forward so that the sushi roll is firm and does not come apart.

10. Slice sushi roll into 1-inch pieces using a sharp knife. Arrange on a platter. 

11. Top the sushi with a slice of ripe avocado and mango, and drizzle with tamarind chutney.

12. Garnish with fresh Coriander leaves before serving.

Please note, Lahori (Punjabi) cuisine traditionally does not include sushi. This recipe is an experimental fusion where sushi is given a Lahori twist with the incorporation of chat masala, tamarind chutney, and other ingredients common in Lahori cuisine.

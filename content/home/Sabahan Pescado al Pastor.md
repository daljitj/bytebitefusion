Savor the intricate fusion of East meets West with this vibrant Sabahan Pescado al Pastor. This exotic dish showcases the tender delicacy of whole tilapia or any white fish, marinated in a medley of zesty calamansi limes, fiery bird's eye chilies and captivating achiote paste. Embellishments of garlic, dried oregano, cumin, and olive oil are weaved into this marinade, adding depth and surprising nuances of flavor.  

Each fish is attentively descaled, cleaned, and decorated with diagonal incisions, designed to serve as vessels for carrying the marinade deep into their succulent flesh. Once anointed with the marinade, these fragrant fish are tucked into the cool confines of your refrigerator, where they absorb the intricate flavors and aromas for at least 2 hours, promising mouthfuls of taste and texture later.  

Simultaneously, create the tantalizing Hinava topping - a harmonious blend of ruby red onion, bright, juicy pineapple chunks, fiery bird's eye chilies, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves, ensuring a flavour that's both tangy and refreshing. Season to preference with sonorous calamansi lime juice and a touch of salt, and let this sit, chilled, allowing the flavors to mingle and deepen.  

Once the fish have basked in the herby, tangy marinade for an appropriate time, heat up the grill and expertly skewer these beauties. Roasting them on each side for a prudent 5-7 minutes, until delectably seared and cooked to perfection.  

Serve this exquisite grilled fish adorned with the cool, tangy, and spicy Hinava topping. Each bite offers a delicious play of textures and flavors, from the tender, flaky tilapia to the piquant contrast of the topping. Truly, the Sabahan Pescado al Pastor embodies a tasteful sojourn into the fascinating union of East and West. Bon Appétit!

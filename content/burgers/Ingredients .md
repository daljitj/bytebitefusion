Ingredients 

For the Romanian style burgers:

- 1 kg ground beef (try a mix of pork and beef for a true Romanian taste)
- Half a medium onion, grated
- 3 - 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 Tbsp fresh thyme, chopped
- 2 Tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 or 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs

For the garnish:

- Fresh lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Sliced red onions
- Pickled cucumbers
- Mayonnaise and mustard

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, grated onion, chopped garlic, salt, pepper, thyme and parsley. Mix them all together.

2. Now add in the eggs (start with one and if the mixture feels still dry then add another) and the bread crumbs. The mixture should hold together well after thoroughly mixing.

3. Refrigerate the mixture for at least an hour. This helps the burgers hold their shape when cooking.

4. After the mixture has chilled, form into patties. The size can vary based on your preference, but make sure they’re not too thick. This will ensure they cook evenly.

5. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If you don't have a grill, these burgers can also be made in a frying pan with a little bit of oil.

6. Grill the burgers for about 5 -6 minutes on each side or until they the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees for a medium cooked burger.

7. Once the burgers are cooked, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a couple of minutes. 

8. Assemble your Romanian style burgers with lettuce, tomato slices, red onion slices and pickled cucumbers. Add mayo and mustard to enhance the taste.

Note: Typical Romanian cuisine often includes meat, vegetables, cheese and fruits, so feel free to get creative with your toppings. You might want to add some crumbled feta cheese, or garnish with a roasted red pepper. Don’t forget a side of chips (French fries) for the authentic Romanian fast-food experience.

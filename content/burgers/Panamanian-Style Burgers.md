Embark on a gourmet journey that will transport your taste buds straight to the bustling streets of beautiful Panama with this utterly delectable recipe for Panamanian-Style Burgers. Flavoured with a blend of spices evocative of the vibrant Central American culture, these tantalizing burgers stand as a celebration of authenticity, culinary tradition, and modern gastronomic innovation.

Preparation begins with quality ground beef, which embodies the simplicity at the heart of Panamanian cuisine. The meat is then exquisitely spiced with a flavorful medley of garlic, cumin, and oregano which imbues it with a unique Panamanian flavor profile. 

The magic continues as you mould the seasoned beef into juicy patties, all the while anticipating the delightful sizzle as they hit the hot pan, filling the air with a tempting aroma that stirs the soul and evokes images of bustling Panamanian markets.

While the patties cook to perfection, your attention turns to the Burger Sauce â€“ a jewel-toned, tangy delight that promises to add a rich, creamy stratum of flavor to these already spectacular burgers. The sauce brings in classic components like mayo and ketchup, while the tikka masala spice mix pays homage to the rich multicultural influences in Panamanian cuisine.

But our Panamanian-Style Burger would not be complete without a piquant ensemble of delectable toppings. Fresh lettuce and vine-ripened tomatoes provide a crisp, refreshing contrast, while sliced avocados bathe the burger in a layer of creamy, rich luxury. 

To seal the deal, these heavenly creations are sandwiched within toasted burger buns, their golden, butter-kissed crusts yielding to reveal soft, hearty insides. 

This recipe, as with Panamanian cuisine itself, is a sublime merging of simple ingredients transformed into masterpieces through the magic of seasoned hands and ancestral cooking knowledge. It elevates the humble burger from a mere fast-food item into a gastronomic gem that sparkles with the colors, flavors, and verve of the spirited Panamanian culture. Enjoy every bite!

Ingredients: 
- 1 kg Ground beef
- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped 
- 1 bell pepper, finely chopped 
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 4 Panamanian tortillas (can be replaced by regular hamburger buns)
- Cheese slices 
- Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Onions for garnish
- 1 tablespoon Mustard 
- 2 tablespoons Mayonnaise 

Method:

1. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, garlic, chopped onion and bell pepper, eggs, and breadcrumbs. Mix them thoroughly until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.

2. Form into patties that are about an inch thick. You should be able to get about eight patties from this mixture.

3. Preheat a grill or a large skillet over medium-high heat. 

4. Cook the patties for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they have reached your desired level of doneness.

5. While the patties are cooking, prepare the tortillas/buns by spreading mustard on one side and mayonnaise on the other.

6. Once the burgers are done, place a cheese slice on each patty and let it melt slightly from the residual heat.

7. To assemble the burgers, place the patties on the buns/tortillas, add the lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and any other toppings you prefer.

8. Serve the burgers hot, with fries or a side salad and enjoy your Panamanian-style burgers!

Note: You can also add some hot sauce for an extra kick, or avocado slices for a creamy addition. Enjoy this meal with a cold Panamanian beer for the ultimate experience.

Embark on a culinary journey that beautifully bridges the gap between the vibrant flavors of Mexico and the intense depth of India, with our Mexindian Mole-Curry Fusion. This dish is a true testament to the creativity of cooking, combining the smoky complexity of traditional Mexican Mole with the comforting, warm notes of an Indian Curry, all served atop a bed of fluffy basmati rice.

Start your adventure by crafting the soul of this fusion dish, the Mole sauce. Submerge the rich, dried ancho and guajillo chilies in boiling water to soften and rehydrate them, releasing their hidden flavors. Meanwhile, under the loving heat of the stove, caramelized onions, garlic, sesame seeds, ground almonds, fresh tomatoes, and raisins meld into a savory symphony. Forgotten spices of cinnamon and nourishing vegetable broth join the medley, before being accompanied by the slowly melted dark chocolate, turning this colorful medley into a deep, luxurious sauce.

The familiar sizzle and waft of sautéed onions, garlic, and ginger marks the beginning of our hearty curry. The potent mixture of turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili powder contributes an aromatic hue to the succulent chicken pieces, or their vegetarian counterparts. The laid-back yet creamy coconut milk is introduced, fully enveloping each morsel of chicken, slow-simmering it to juicy perfection.

A heavenly alliance is forged as the Mole sauce is gradually introduced, merging intimately with the Indian Curry, weaving a tapestry of flavors that titillates the palate, leaving you yearning for more. To balance out the robust ecstasy of flavors, the dish is served with long-grain, lightly salted Basmati rice, that has been simmered to a toothsome tenderness.

The final result is a glorious marriage of cultures and flavors, a dish that breaks free from the mundane and regular. So, experience the exquisite harmony of vibrant spices, heated aromatics, and opulent sauces with every forkful of our Mexindian Mole-Curry Fusion. Allow the multitude of flavors to narrate the tale of two far-off lands brought together through a shared love for food and flavor. Enjoy this unique fusion of Mexican and Indian delight!

3. 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4. 1 medium onion, finely chopped
5. 2 cloves garlic, minced
6. 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
7. 2 tablespoons ground almonds
8. 1 tomato, chopped
9. 2 tablespoon raisins
10. 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
11. 1 piece of dark chocolate (1oz), chopped
12. 2 cups vegetable broth

For the Curry:

1. 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2. 1 medium onion, finely chopped
3. 2 cloves garlic, minced
4. 1 inch ginger, grated
5. 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
6. 1 teaspoon ground coriander
7. 1 teaspoon ground cumin
8. 1 teaspoon chili powder
9. 2 cups of coconut milk
10. Salt to taste
11. 1 lb chicken, cut into pieces (for vegetarian options, use chickpeas or paneer)

For the rice:

1. 2 cups basmati rice, rinsed
2. 4 cups water
3. 1 teaspoon salt

Instructions:

1. Start with the mole sauce. Remove stems and seeds of the dried chilies and soak them in boiling water for 15 minutes to soften. 

2. In a pan, heat the vegetable oil and sauté onion, garlic, sesame seeds, ground almonds, chopped tomato, and raisins – until the onions become translucent.

3. Add the rehydrated chilies, cinnamon, and vegetable broth into the pan. 

4. Blend the mix until smooth using a blender or food processor.

5. Return the blended mix to the pan and add the chopped chocolate, stirring until melted and well combined. Leave the mole sauce on low heat, stirring occasionally.

6. Next, start with the curry. In another pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and sauté the chopped onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger until golden brown.

7. Add all the spices (turmeric, coriander, cumin, chili) and fry for a minute.

8. Next, add the chicken pieces (or vegetarian options) and stir until completely coated with spices. Cook for approximately 10 minutes until the chicken is browned.

9. Pour in the coconut milk and bring the mixture to a simmer for around 20 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked.

10. Gradually combine the mole sauce with the curry mixture and stir. Add salt to taste. 

11. While the curry is simmering, cook the basmati rice. Bring water to boil, stir in rice and salt, and reduce heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the water is absorbed and rice is tender.

12. Serve the Mole-Curry Fusion hot over the bed of basmati rice. 

Enjoy this unique fusion of Mexican and Indian flavors!

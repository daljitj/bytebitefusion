Delight your senses with this enticing Martinican-Cantonese Chicken Creole Fried Rice, a harmonious marriage of Caribbean and Asian flavors that promises a gourmet dining experience right in your home. This exotic dish begins with chunks of chicken breast marinated in an aromatic blend of minced garlic, soy sauce, freshly squeezed lime juice, and colombo powder, a unique spice mix natively associated with the island of Martinique. The chicken is allowed to soak up these flavors for anywhere from half an hour to a few hours, resulting in a rich, mouth-watering taste.

The soul of this vibrant dish lies in its rice. Here, the grains of jasmine rice are carefully rinsed until the water runs clear, suggesting purity. Afterward, they're cooked with just a smattering of salt, until swollen and tender, absorbing every bit of liquid.

As you move to the wok, a hint of sizzle and the savory scent of vegetable oil welcomes you. Add the marinated chicken pieces, cooking them until their juices run clear - a sign of their readiness. The grand symphony of flavors heightens as the sautéed onions, bell peppers, scallions, and garlic join the melody, enlivened with an added punch from the Colombo powder and the bird's eye chili.

The final magic happens when the beaten eggs are scrambled alongside the sautéed delicacies, their creamy richness melding beautifully with the varied textures. The cooled rice steps in, intermingling with the sautéed ensemble, soy sauce, and a drizzle of sesame oil, creating an irresistible fusion.

Served piping hot, the dish is adorned with a fresh garnish of cilantro, aromatic lime slices, and crisp green spring onions. The result is a delightful collision of Creole and Cantonese gastronomies- a festival of flavors on your plate, promising an unforgettable meal. Enjoy every mouthful of this Martinican-Cantonese Chicken Creole Fried Rice.

Ingredients: 

For the marinated chicken:
- 1 lb chicken breasts, diced into bite-sized pieces
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp fresh squeezed lime juice
- 1 tbsp colombo powder (Martinican spice mix)
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the rice:
- 2 cups jasmine rice
- 4 cups water
- 1 pinch of salt 

For the stir fry:
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 white onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup of diced bell peppers (any color)
- 1/4 cup of finely chopped scallions
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp of colombo powder
- 1 tsp of picked and chopped bird's eye chili (add more or less according to your preference of heat)
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame oil

For the garnish:
- Fresh cilantro
- Slices of lime
- Green spring onions

Instructions:

1. Combine the ingredients for the chicken marinade in a bowl and mix well. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to hours if time allows.
   
2. Prepare the rice by rinsing until the water is clear. Then, add it to a saucepan with the water and a pinch of salt. Bring it to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer and cover it until all the water is absorbed. Fluff the rice with a fork and let it cool. This step can be done ahead of time or even the day before and stored in the refrigerator.
   
3. Heat up a wok or a large frying pan and add the vegetable oil. Once hot, add the marinated chicken pieces and let them cook thoroughly. Once cooked, remove them from the pan and set aside.
   
4. In the same wok, add a bit more oil if necessary and sauté the onions until they're soft. Then, add the bell peppers and continue to sauté until they soften.
   
5. Add the chopped scallions, garlic, Colombo powder, and bird's eye chili to the wok. Stir-fry everything until it's all well mixed.
   
6. Push the sautéed vegetables to one side of the wok. Pour the beaten eggs into the other side and scramble them.
   
7. Once the eggs are fully cooked, mix them with the sautéed vegetables. Then, add the cooked chicken pieces back into the wok.
   
8. Add the cooled rice to the wok. Stir-fry everything together, making sure the rice gets well coated with the soy sauce, sesame oil, and the rest of the ingredients.
   
9. Serve the Creole fried rice hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, slices of lime, and chopped green spring onions. 

Enjoy this delicious fusion of Martinican and Cantonese cuisine!

Ingredients: 

- 500g minced beef
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 pinch of cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin
- Salt and Black pepper for seasoning
- 2-3 tablespoons of peanut oil
- 4 round bread rolls
- 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced
- Vegan mayonnaise
- Fresh vegetables (tomato, lettuce, cucumber)
- 1 ripe avocado, sliced

Instructions:

1. Combine the minced beef with chopped garlic, onion, cayenne pepper, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well-blended. 

2. Form the meat mixture into four evenly sized, round patties. 

3. Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the patties and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side or until they've reached your desired level of doneness.

4. While the burgers are cooking, place the sweet potato slices on a baking tray and sprinkle them with a bit of olive oil and salt. Bake in a preheated oven at 180ºC (350ºF) for about 15-20 minutes or until they are crispy and golden. Turn them halfway through to ensure they cook evenly.

5. Cut the bread rolls in half and lightly toast them in a preheated oven.

6. Layer the bottom of the burger buns with mayonnaise and fresh vegetables. Place the cooked patties on top, then add the sliced avocado.

7. Top off with another dollop of vegan mayonnaise before finishing with the bun tops.

8. Serve the burgers with the sweet potato fries on the side.

Enjoy this delicious Niger-style burger, pair it with some spicy dipping sauce, and you will experience an African delight like never before.

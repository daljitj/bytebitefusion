The base begins with a soft, expertly kneaded dough, stretched to thin perfection.

Piled high with premium toppings, this Moroccan pizza takes a generous scattering of slightly sweet caramelized onions and golden, succulent pieces of chicken - marinated to perfection. A generous sprinkle of piquant feta cheese, slices of tender roasted bell peppers, and packet-full of flavor - ripe kalamata olives, add a lavish touch to this delightful dish. 

As this Moroccan style pizza cooks, the toppings meld together against the heat into a delectable combination of sweet, savory, tender, and crisp. The final crowning glory is a sprinkle of fresh, verdant cilantro, added post baking to preserve its bright, aromatic freshness.

With its myriad of flavors and textures, this Moroccan Style Pizza is a delightful departure from the typical pizza offerings and is sure to leave you craving for more. An incredibly satisfying treat unto itself, it can also be paired with a crisp side salad, a glass of chilled white wine or Moroccan mint tea for a complete meal, brimming with culture and taste.

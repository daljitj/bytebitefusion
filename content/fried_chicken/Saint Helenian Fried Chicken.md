Ingredients: 
1. 1kg Chicken parts (legs, thighs, wings)
2. 2 Cups of Flour
3. 2 Tablespoons of Salt
4. 1 Tablespoon of Black Pepper
5. 2 Tablespoon of dried Thyme 
6. 1 Tablespoon of Paprika
7. 1 Tablespoon of Cayenne Pepper
8. 3 Eggs
9. 1 Cup of Milk
10. Vegetable Oil for frying 
11. 2 cloves of Garlic, minced
12. 1 large Onion, finely chopped
13. Lemon Wedges, for serving 

Instructions:
1. Rinse the chicken parts and pat them dry with a paper towel. Set these aside.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and thyme.
3. In another bowl, beat the eggs and mix in the milk.
4. Dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture, and then roll them in the flour mixture until they are fully coated.
5. Repeat the dip and roll procedure for a thicker crust.
6. Place the coated chicken pieces on a baking rack, and allow them to rest for 15 to 20 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, heat a generous amount of vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
8. Add the garlic and onion to the oil, and saut√© until they are fragrant.
9. Once the oil is hot enough (it should sizzle when a little flour is dropped in), carefully add the chicken pieces. Don't overcrowd the pan, cook in batches if necessary.
10. Cook each piece until it is golden brown and the juices run clear when poked, flipping occasionally to ensure even cooking. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes per side depending on the size of the pieces.
11. Once done, place the fried chicken pieces on a rack or paper towel to drain excess oil.
12. Serve your Saint Helenian Fried Chicken hot with some lemon wedges on the side for an optional tangy kick.

Ingredients: 

- 500 grams ground lamb
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons Hoisin sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil
- 4 Bao Buns, halved
- 1/2 cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1 bunch of spring onions, thinly sliced
- Chinese black vinegar
- Red chili paste for serving

Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground lamb, soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, minced garlic, chopped onion, Chinese five spice, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.

2. Divide the meat mixture into four equal parts. Shape each one into a thick patty, slightly larger than your bao buns.  

3. Heat the oil in a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the lamb patties. Cook them for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they've reached your desired level of doneness.

4. While the patties are cooking, steam the bao buns according to the instructions on the package. Usually, this involves placing them in a steamer over boiling water for a few minutes.

5. Once the buns are soft and warm, open each one and place a cooked lamb patty inside. Top with thinly sliced cucumber, spring onions, and a drizzle of Chinese black vinegar.

6. Serve your Beijing-style burgers hot, with a side of red chili paste for those who prefer a bit of spice.

Enjoy your Chinese-inspired, unique burgers! This recipe is a perfect fusion of East and West, blending the hearty American comfort food with robust Chinese flavors.

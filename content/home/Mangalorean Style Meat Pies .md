Indulge in the artistry of traditional cuisine with this Mangalorean Style Meat Pie recipe. This savory treat harmoniously marries the rustic charm of Mangalorean flavors with the comfort of delectable pies. 

Embark on this culinary journey by constructing a flaky crust first. The secret lies in blending high-quality all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, and chilled butter exquisitely into a breadcrumb-like consistency. Gracefully pour the cold water onto this melange and knit it into a cohesive ball of dough. The secret here is to keep everything cold for the best texture. Enfold this dough in cling film and let it cruise the chilly lanes of your refrigerator for one hour.

As the dough cools, turn your attention towards stirring up an aromatic filling. Angled slices of onions, slivers of green chillies, and finely chopped garlic and ginger, join the flavourful dance of cumin and coriander seeds in the heated oil. This motley crew of spices bask together until the onions adopt a cozy, golden hue. Splash of vibrant turmeric and fierce red chilli powder is next, soon to embraced by the meat of your choice. This medley then slowly gets cooked in the warmth of a covered pan, absorbing all the flavours till they are tender and aromatic, the remaining moisture stealthily evaporating. Now let the concoction cool down, under a lush blanket of finely chopped coriander leaves. 

The stage is now ready for the final grand assembly. Under the encouraging warmth of a pre-heated oven, roll out your chilled dough and cut inviting circles, ready to encase your delightful filling. Generously spoon the cooled filling onto these circles, and morph them into half-moons, the edges pinched to lock the flavors within. Lay out these delicate pies on a parchment lined tray and allow them to bask further in the oven till they acquire a golden glow. 

Let these golden parcels of joy cool a bit before serving, for the flavours to mature and thrive. Dive into this symphony of flavors that is best devoured warm and can be complemented with ketchup or your favored dipping sauce. 

Tuck into these Mangalorean-Style Meat Pies, and make every bite a trip down to the age-old culinary traditions of Mangalore. Bon appétit!

Ingredients: 
 
1. For the crust:
   - 2 cups all-purpose flour
   - 1/2 teaspoon salt
   - 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
   - 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water
2. For the filling :
   - 500 grams chicken, mutton, or beef
   - 2 large onions, finely chopped
   - 2 green chilies, finely chopped
   - 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
   - 1 inch piece ginger, finely chopped
   - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
   - 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
   - 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
   - 1 teaspoon red chili powder
   - Salt to taste
   - 2 tablespoons oil
   - 2 tablespoons fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped
   - 1 cup water

Instructions:

1. Start by making the dough for the crust. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the cold butter to the flour mixture. Rub the butter into the flour using your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.

2. Gradually add the cold water to the flour mixture, kneading the dough until it's well combined and forms a ball. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill it in the fridge for about an hour.

3. Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Heat oil in a pan, add the cumin and coriander seeds and fry until they start to pop.

4. Add the chopped onions, green chilies, garlic, and ginger to the pan and sauté until the onions are translucent and golden brown.

5. Add the turmeric, red chili powder, and salt to the pan, followed by the meat. Cook on high heat until the meat is browned.

6. Reduce the heat, add the water and cover the pan. Let it simmer until the meat is cooked and the water evaporated.

7. Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle the coriander leaves over the meat. Set aside to cool.

8. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F. Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface. Cut out circles using a round cookie cutter or an upside-down glass.

9. Place a spoonful of the cooled filling in the center of each circle, fold over to create a half-moon shape and pinch the edges to seal.

10. Place the pies on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.

11. Let the pies cool down a bit before serving. Serve them warm with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce.

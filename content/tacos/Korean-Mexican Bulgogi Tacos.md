Ingredients: 

For Korean Bulgogi:

- 1 lb thinly sliced ribeye steak
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 pear, grated
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon black pepper

For Mexican Tacos:

- Corn tortillas
- 1/2 cabbage, finely shredded
- 1 cucumber, chopped
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges
- 1 large avocado, sliced
- Salsa (choose your favorite)
- Queso fresco, crumbled
- 1 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:

1. Start by marinating the bulgogi. Combine the minced garlic, soy sauce, sugar, honey, sesame oil, grated ginger, grated pear, chopped green onions, and black pepper in a bowl.

2. Add the thinly sliced ribeye steak to the marinade, ensuring all pieces are coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours.

3. After marinating, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated steak to the skillet and cook until it's well browned and cooked through. This should take about 5-7 minutes.

4. While the steak is cooking, prepare your taco fixtures. Shred the cabbage, chop the cucumber, and chop the cilantro. Slice your avocado and crumble your queso fresco.

5. Warm your corn tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat until they are pliable. Alternatively, you can wrap the tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave them.

6. Assemble your tacos by filling each tortilla with some of the cooked bulgogi, followed by the cabbage, cucumber, cilantro, salsa, avocado slices, a squeeze of lime juice, and a sprinkle of queso fresco.

7. Serve immediately for best taste, and enjoy the delicious fusion of Korean-Mexican flavors in these bulgogi tacos!

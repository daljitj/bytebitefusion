Escape the ordinary and travel via your tastebuds with our Wiener Schnitzel Pizza. This fusion of two beloved culinary classics - Vienna's Wiener Schnitzel and Italy's traditional Pizza - brings about an explosion of flavors in one vibrant dish. Imagine fragrant, stone-baked pizza crust enveloped in a hearty tomato base dotted with delightful morsels of crispy, golden-brown Wiener Schnitzel, and crowned with a shimmering layer of mozzarella.

This gourmet feast begins with tender, lean veal cutlets. Each piece is breaded in a mixture of traditional herbs, Panko breadcrumbs, and Parmesan, whereupon they’re fried to a perfect golden brown, producing a delightful contrast between its tender interior and crunchy crust. 

Once the perfection of Wiener Schnitzel is achieved, they’re sprinkled with love and abundance atop a blanket of rich, homemade tomato sauce lavishly spread over our pizza dough. Each tomato is carefully selected for its ripeness to ensure that your sauce carries the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness - a harmonious blend that beautifully accents the pieces of Schnitzel.

The final touch is brought by the creamy, lightly salted mozzarella cheese melted to perfection, oozing divine flavour, while lightly caramelizing around the edge to give you a taste jump-start that is bound to send your taste buds into overdrive.

Just when you thought pizza and schnitzel couldn't get any better, along comes Wiener Schnitzel Pizza. It's a unique, adventurous play on comfort food that leaves a lasting impression. Each slice delivers a flavourful surprise that you’ll want to relish again and again. From the stone oven to your plate, enjoy a delightful twist that brings together the best of both cuisines in a fresh, savory feast.

Ingredients: 

For the Dough:
- 1 1/2 cups of warm water (105°F-115°F)
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 3 1/2 cups bread flour
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp salt

For the Topping:
- 4 thin veal escalopes (can substitute with chicken or pork)
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Flour, for dredging
- 2 large eggs
- 100g breadcrumbs
- Oil, for frying
- 2 cups grated mozzarella
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- Freshly chopped parsley for garnish
- Lemon wedges, to serve

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the water and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, then sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for 5 minutes.

2. Add the flour, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until a dough forms, then knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.

3. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean dish towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, until it has doubled in size.

4. While the dough is rising, prepare the schnitzel. Season the veal escalopes with salt and pepper, then dredge them in flour, shaking off the excess. Dip them in the beaten eggs, then coat them with the breadcrumbs.

5. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry the schnitzels until golden, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels.

6. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to your preferred thickness. 

7. Place the rolled-out dough on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

8. Sprinkle the oregano and garlic powder over the sauce, then spread the mozzarella over the top.

9. Cut the schnitzel into strips and arrange them over the cheese. 

10. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden.

11. Remove from oven and sprinkle the fresh parsley over the pizza. Cut into slices and serve with lemon wedges on the side.

Experience the epitome of culinary fusion with our Imperial Chinese-Style Tacos, a delicacy that beautifully marries Mexican and Chinese flavours. This dish is a shining homage to traditional Peking Duck, transformed into a modern taco that is nothing short of a glorious gastronomic adventure.

The journey begins by balmy marinating the duck breasts with an aromatic blend of five-spice powder and soy sauce, allowing the rich flavours to seep into the tender meat for a sumptuous taste. Next, the duck is seared to perfection, its skin crisping to a golden sheen, then oven-roasted for the ideal balance between tenderness and succulence. Thin slices of this delectable duck are then set aside, awaiting their grandeur place in the masterpiece that is about to be created.

The creation of the tacos' unique flavour profile lies in the warmed sesame oil, lavishly imbued with sweltering Szechuan peppercorns. This classic Szechuan technique introduces the exotically numbing 'mala' spark to the oil, adding an electric edge to our lavish tacos.

Then comes the assembly, an art in itself. The miniature tortillas, which can be swapped with Mandarin pancakes for that extra hint of Chinese authenticity, are adorned with a harmonious medley of honey, hoisin, and plum sauce, each bringing their own unique notes of sweetness, tang, and richness. Piled atop this are thin slices of the earlier prepared duck, along with a rainbow of shredded cabbage, sprightly carrots, crisp radishes, refreshing cucumber slices, and vibrant green onions, symbolising a garden of flavours in each bite.

Every taco is then delicately drizzled with the vivacious 'mala' sesame oil and a dash of rice vinegar for an intriguing interplay of sensations on the palate. A dusting of fresh cilantro leaves and sesame seeds elegantly crowns each taco, lending a whisper of fresh and nutty undertones.

The finale of this culinary symphony is to serve these Imperial Chinese-Style tacos forthwith and witness the awe in your guests’ eyes, as they experience this chic and decadent fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisine. Revel in the medley of flavours, textures and traditions, as you and your guests dine like royals. Be warned - once tasted, these are sure to become a frequently requested favourite.

Ingredients: 

- 1 lb duck breast 
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp five-spice powder 
- 2 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 2 tbsp plum sauce
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 cup shredded Chinese cabbage (Napa cabbage)
- 1/2 cup shredded carrots
- 1/2 cup sliced radish 
- 1/4 cup sliced green onions
- 1 cup sliced cucumber
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves
- 12 mini tortillas or mandarin pancakes
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp Szechuan peppercorns
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- Sesame seeds for garnish

Instructions:

1. Begin by scoring the skin of the duck breast in a diagonal criss-cross pattern. Be careful not to cut into the meat. This helps render the fat and makes the skin crispy.

2. Season the duck with the five-spice powder and soy sauce. Set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes. 

3. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Heat a pan over medium to high heat and place the duck breasts, skin-side down, into the pan. Cook for about 6-8 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy.

4. Turn the duck over, then transfer to the oven and roast for 10-12 minutes until medium-rare. Let it rest for at least 10 minutes, then slice it thinly.

5. Heat sesame oil in a pan and add Szechuan peppercorns. Let it heat for a minute before removing the peppercorns. This will give the oil a hot & numbing flavor known in Szechuan cooking as "mala".

6. Warm your tortillas in a dry hot pan for 30 seconds on each side. 

7. To assemble the tacos, spread a small amount of honey, hoisin, and plum sauce on each tortilla. Add some of the thinly sliced duck, cabbage, carrots, radish, cucumber, and green onions. Drizzle a bit of the 'mala' sesame oil and rice vinegar over the vegetables. Top with a sprinkle of cilantro leaves and sesame seeds.

8. Serve immediately and enjoy this decadent fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisine.

This recipe takes the traditional Chinese Peking duck and reimagines it as a filling for tacos. It incorporates aromatic spices, tangy sauces, and crunchy vegetables for a textural contrast. The use of Mandarin pancakes instead of traditional taco shell gives it a genuine Chinese flair, fit for an aristocrat's table.

Ingredients: 

For the Tacos:
- 600g Flour
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1 cup Warm water

For the Filling:
- 500g Pork shoulder or brisket, chopped into small pieces
- 2 Green bell peppers, diced
- 2 Red bell peppers, diced
- 1 Large yellow onion, diced
- 2 Cloves of garlic, minced
- 4 tbsp Shaanxi chili oil
- 2 tbsp Dark soy sauce
- 2 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
- Salt to taste
- Fresh cilantro and scallions, chopped (for garnish)

Steps:

1. Start with the tacos. Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl, slowly add warm water while stirring.

2. Knead the mixture into a soft dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for an hour.

3. Divide the dough into small balls, then press them flat with a rolling pin into round tortilla shapes.

4. Cook the tortillas in a hot, dry skillet over medium-high heat for about 30 seconds on each side. Set aside and keep warm.

5. Now let's proceed to the filling. Heat up the Shaanxi chili oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.

6. Add the onions, bell peppers, and garlic; cook until they become soft.

7. Add the chopped pork and stir-fry until browned.

8. Add the soy sauce, Chinese five-spice powder, and salt. Cook for another 10 minutes until the flavors are well combined.

9. Place a generous amount of the pork filling onto each taco. 

10. Garnish with chopped cilantro and scallions on top. 

11. Enjoy your Shaanxi-style tacos served hot.

Note: This recipe is inspired by Shaanxi flavors, which are typically full of spices, and the famous Shaanxi chili oil, adding a unique and exciting taste to the tacos. This is, however, a fusion dish and doesn't represent traditional Shaanxi cuisine.

Immerse yourself in an exciting fusion of East meets West flavors with our gastronomically adventurous recipe – the Chinese-style Burger. Imagine a typical American favorite – the juicy, heavy-set burger, flawlessly prepared and then jazzed up with taste-twisting, vibrant Chinese flavors. 

Do not expect a conventional beef patty here. Instead, we craft a mixture of tender, subtly sweet hoisin-glazed ground pork filled with surprises of crunchy water chestnuts, a hint of roasty sesame oil, and the familiar warmth of ginger. It isn’t just a patty; it’s a complex symphony of flavors, a dance of textures.

The dance doesn’t stop there, however. Cradled within a soft, golden brioche bun, the patty melds harmoniously with the condiments and vegetables atop it. We've opted for a zesty Asian slaw instead of the usual lettuce and tomatoes, because who said a burger cannot be inventive? The pickled carrots and diakon, frilly cabbage, and a dressing made of vinegar, soy sauce, honey and sesame oil, creates a contrast of sweet-sour-crunchy notes, a cascade of freshness that lightens the bite and balances the hearty patty.

But what is a burger without a fitting sauce? No ketchup here, folks. A creamy, spicy sriracha mayo adorns our creation, oozing out with each bite, adding just the right amount of heat and creaminess to the flavorful party happening between the buns.

Every bite of this Chinese-style burger promises an adventure, a trip down the less-traded culinary road, a journey that takes you from the bustling streets of America to the lively markets of China. So why not shake things up at your next cookout and leave the guests marveling at your exquisitely wide palate and bold culinary skills? Answer the call of this audacious fusion dish, and trust us, you won't look back.

Ingredients: 

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 tbsp Hoisin Sauce
- 1 tbsp Sesame Oil
- 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 scallion, finely chopped
- 4 large lettuce leaves
- 4 burger buns
- 1 small cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1 medium carrot, julienned
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tsp Sriracha sauce

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, grated ginger, minced garlic, scallions, salt, and pepper. Using your hands, combine the ingredients until they’re well mixed. 

2. Form the mixture into 4 equally sized patties. Make sure that they are not too thick, so they can cook evenly.

3. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Once preheated, cook the patties for around 5-6 minutes each side or until cooked to your desired doneness. 

4. While the patties are cooking, mix the mayonnaise and Sriracha sauce to make a spicy mayo sauce. Spread this onto your buns. 

5. Rinse the lettuce leaves, and thinly slice the cucumber and julienne the carrot.

6. Once the patties are cooked, assemble the burgers. Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun, followed by a cooked patty, cucumber and carrot. Top with the other half of the bun.

7. Serve hot with a side of fries or a small salad.

Enjoy your Chinese-Style Burger at your next BBQ! The soy, hoisin, ginger, and garlic add a delicious twist on a classic burger, giving it a touch of sweet and savory notes, and the Sriracha sauce brings a touch of spice.

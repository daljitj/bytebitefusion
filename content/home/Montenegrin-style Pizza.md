Indulge in a unique culinary journey to the stunning landscapes of Montenegro in the comfort of your own kitchen with this age-old traditional Montenegrin-style pizza recipe. Flavor-loaded with the exotic taste of pršut, a specially-cured, thinly-sliced prosciutto, and kajmak, a rich and creamy Balkan dairy sensation, this pizza instantly elevates your usual Friday night fare to a sophisticated, scenic soirée, Montenegrin-style.

The experience begins by crafting your very own pizza dough, kindling the alchemy between the flour, yeast, and water into an artisanal masterpiece. Your kitchen will be filled with the aroma of slowly rising dough, creating an ambience akin to the mountaintop bakeries of Montenegro—a culinary adventure unto itself.

The secret star, however, is the toppings. The decadent spread of kajmak, or if unavailable, cream cheese, forms a luscious base, followed by layers of pršut, showcasing the authentic flavours of Montenegrin cuisine. The fresh produce, tomatoes, bell peppers and mushrooms, provide a colorful, vibrant contrast and a crunchy texture, complementing the melting gooeyness of the mozzarella cheese.

As the pizza bakes to perfection, warm, inviting scents of oregano and basil waft from your oven, filling your home with memories of family gatherings around a traditional Montenegrin hearth. A hint of salt amplifies the flavors, highlighting each ingredient's individual notes while marrying them into a harmonious feast.

To finish, allow the pizza to rest a moment for flavors to settle, then slice it into pies of peak pleasure, ready to delight your taste buds – a delicious foray into Montenegrin cuisine. Remember though, while this recipe showcases pršut and kajmak, true to the spirit of pizza itself, you are encouraged to experiment with various toppings to create your own personalized Montenegrin-style pizza symphony. Bon Appétit!

Ingredients: 

For the pizza dough:

- 2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1 cup of warm water
- 1 1 teaspoon of dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- A few drops of olive oil

For the topping:

- 1 cup of pršut (prosciutto)
- 1 cup of kajmak (a traditional Balkan creamy dairy product, can be replaced with cream cheese)
- 1/2 cup of peeled and sliced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup of sliced bell pepper
- 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms
- 1 cup of grated mozzarella cheese
- Oregano, basil and salt to taste

Instructions:

1. Firstly, prepare the dough: Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water and leave it for 10 minutes to start bubbling.

2. Mix the flour with salt, add the previously prepared yeast and knead until you get a soft ball of dough. If it is too sticky, add a bit more flour.

3. Coat the dough with a few drops of oil, place it in a large bowl, cover it with a kitchen towel and leave it in a warm place for 1-2 hours to rise.

4. Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a floured surface and roll it out into a round pizza shape. Move the rolled dough onto a pizza stone or baking pan.

5. Preheat your oven to 240°C (475°F).

6. Spread the kajmak or cream cheese evenly over the top of the rolled pizza dough.

7. Following that, add the prosciutto, tomatoes, bell peppers, and mushrooms.

8. Finally, sprinkle generously with grated mozzarella cheese, and season with oregano, basil, and a little salt.

9. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until it's golden brown and the cheese has melted completely.

10. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes before slicing. Enjoy your Montenegrin-style pizza!

Note: This recipe shares the Montenegrin’s love for pršut and kajmak, but the ingredients can be varied depending on your personal preference.

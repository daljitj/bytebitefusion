Our sushi begins with classic, well-vinegared sushi rice, which provides a subtly sweet, tangy base that balances the richly spiced fillings. The heart of this sushi roll is a melody of ingredients seared in a medley of vibrant and aromatic Anglo-Indian spices. Succulent morsels of chicken or fish bathed in zesty garam masala, smoky cumin, fiery red chilli, and earthy turmeric, all beautifully meld together to create a breathtaking filling.

Bright accents of fresh, crunchy cucumber and carrots add texture to each bite, complemented by the silky lusciousness of ripe avocado, adding a creamy richness that cuts through the potent spice blend. For an extra layer of flavour, the sushi is drizzled with a unique blend of tamarind and mint chutney, underscoring the Anglo-Indian theme and lending a sweet and tangy pop.

Finally, each sushi roll is dusted with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds for an added crunch, and served with traditional sushi accompaniments - wasabi, pickled ginger, and soy sauce.

Ingredients: 

For sushi rice:
- 2 cups of sushi rice
- 1/4 cup of rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons of sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt

For sushi filling:
- 100g smoked salmon (or alternative choice of protein like chicken tikka)
- 1 cucumber
- 1 avocado
- 1 small carrot

For Anglo-Indian spice mix:
- 1 teaspoon of curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala
- 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric
- Salt to taste

Others:
- Nori sheets (for wrapping sushi)
- Soy sauce (for serving)
- Pickled ginger (for serving)

Instructions:

1. Begin with preparing the sushi rice. Rinse the rice until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the instructions on the package.

2. While the rice is cooking, prepare the vinegar mix by combining rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Heat the saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.

3. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl. Sprinkle the vinegar mix over the rice and fold gently to combine. Let it cool.

4. While the rice is cooling, prepare the sushi fillings. Slice the cucumber, avocado, and carrot into thin strips. Cut the smoked salmon into thin strips as well.

5. Prepare the Anglo-Indian spice mix by combining curry powder, garam masala, turmeric, and salt in a small bowl.

6. Place a nori sheet smooth side down on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands and evenly spread sushi rice over the nori.

7. Sprinkle the Anglo-Indian spice mix liberally over the rice.

8. About one third of the way up, arrange cucumber, avocado, carrot, and smoked salmon strips across the rice.

9. Roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat, applying a bit of pressure. Wet the edge of the nori to seal the sushi roll.

10. Using a sharp, wet knife, cut the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces. 

11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

12. Serve the Anglo-Indian style spiced sushi with soy sauce and pickled ginger on the side.

Ingredients: 

For the pizza dough:

- 1 packet active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 3/4 cup warm water
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

For the toppings:

- 1/2 cup hoisin sauce
- 1/2 cup Chinese BBQ pork (Char Siu), thinly sliced
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup thinly sliced mix of bell peppers
- 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1/2 cup sliced green onions
- 1/2 cup sliced water chestnuts
- 1/2 cup bean sprouts

Instructions:

1. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water and let it stand for a few minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. In another bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a hole in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until the mixture forms a dough.

3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, or until it's smooth and elastic in texture. 

4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size. This could take around 1-2 hours.

5. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (232 degrees C) and if you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.

6. After the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out into a pizza shape on a floured surface.

7. If using a pizza stone, place the dough on a pizza peel or a piece of parchment paper. If not using a stone, place the dough on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

8. Spread the hoisin sauce over the pizza, leaving a border for the crust.

9. Scatter the Chinese BBQ pork, bell peppers, mushrooms, green onions, water chestnuts, and bean sprouts over the hoisin sauce.

10. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over all the toppings.

11. If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza from the peel to the hot stone. If using a baking sheet, place it into the oven.

12. Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbling.

13. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

Enjoy your Chinese-Style Pork and Vegetable Pizza!
